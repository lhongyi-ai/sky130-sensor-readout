# Spike: E&M field simulation — engine survey

**Status:** spike / proposal. Nothing here is scheduled, and nothing here
authorises implementation. Per
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) → "How capabilities arrive," a
major capability arrives by spiking a design epic first — candidate-engine
survey, proposed JSON contract, wrap/build decision — and this document is
that spike for E&M field simulation. It is the sibling of
[docs/design/spice-corner-runner-spike.md](spice-corner-runner-spike.md)
(issue #27), which did the same thing for SPICE corner running; the shape of
this document mirrors that one deliberately. A follow-up epic, filed
separately once this spike is reviewed, would carry the build.

**Demand signal:** operator request (2026-07-31) to add full field
simulation, and a concrete stalled use case: the knowledge-base entry
[`kb/entries/sky130-spiral-inductor.json`](../../kb/entries/sky130-spiral-inductor.json)
already documents that sky130 ships no characterized inductor primitive, so a
spiral's L/Q/self-resonant-frequency come only from the Yue & Wong analytic
pi-model as a first-pass estimate — the entry's own `notes` field says
outright to "budget schedule for EM simulation … to validate the analytical
sizing estimate before tapeout." Any PHY-class block with an on-chip
inductor, MOM/MIM cap, deliberately-modeled interconnect, or a characterized
block boundary hits the same wall: the closed loop's
"simulation-verified" step (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md → Vision) does not cover
passives and interconnect, because SPICE has no model for them without a
field solve upstream of it. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` → "In-house prior art"
already names geode-fem as a candidate engine for exactly this gap, not just
an idea source — this spike is the survey that decision requires before
`klt` grows an E&M verb.

## 1. Use cases, ranked

| Rank | Use case | Regime | Why |
| ---- | -------- | ------ | --- |
| 1 | Spiral inductor L / Q / SRF extraction | Quasi-static up to self-resonance; **full-wave** to capture Q and SRF accurately | Has a KB entry today (`sky130-spiral-inductor`) documenting the exact gap, and is geode-fem's own flagship validated benchmark — the closest thing to a ready-made oracle comparison this survey can point to. |
| 2 | MOM/MIM cap C + Q | Mostly **quasi-static** (electrostatic C dominates); finite-frequency Q needs loss-tangent/skin-effect physics a static solve omits | Geometrically the simplest 3D field problem of the four (parallel/interdigitated plates, no wave ports), so the cheapest place to validate the geometry pipeline end-to-end before tackling ports. |
| 3 | On-chip T-line / interconnect RLGC | **Quasi-static**, as long as line length stays well under the signal wavelength (true for most on-chip routing; stops being true for mm-wave PHY lines) | Classically FastHenry/FastCap territory (per-unit-length RLGC from a 2D cross-section solve) — cheapest regime, but needs the geometry path to walk a real routing cross-section, not just a lumped device footprint. |
| 4 | Block-boundary S-parameters | **Full-wave**, essentially always (wave ports, propagation, radiation/coupling all require it) | The general case and the hardest one: wave-port definition and a full driven solve are exactly what geode-fem's port infrastructure (lumped + multi-mode wave ports, block S-matrix) already targets, but it is also the most demanding on the geometry pipeline (arbitrary port placement at a layout boundary, not just device terminals). |

The ranking is by tractability-times-demand, not by importance: #1 and #2 are
where the geometry pipeline (Section 2) can be proven out on genuinely cheap
problems (a spiral is one net wound in one metal layer; a MOM cap is two
plates) before the pipeline has to handle arbitrary wave-port placement for
#4. A follow-on epic's first vertical slice should be #1, not because it is
easiest in isolation but because it already has a KB entry, an in-house
benchmark to anchor an oracle comparison against, and a documented open gap
in a real block.

## 2. Geometry path: GDS + sky130 stackup → solver mesh

This is the hard integration, and this spike does not attempt to solve it —
only to describe its shape and confirm it stays headless and NDA-free.

**Inputs already available in this repo.** `klt layers` (Phase 1) already
parses per-layer polygon geometry out of a GDSII/OASIS file headlessly via
`pya`; `klt layout-metrics`'s "block directory" convention
(docs/cli/layout-metrics.md) already gives a standard place to point a
command at a block. Neither currently carries a third (z) dimension — GDS
layers are 2D polygons keyed by `(layer, datatype)`, with no per-layer height
or thickness in the file itself.

**What is missing: a stackup.** The z-axis geometry — each metal/via layer's
height above substrate, thickness, and each dielectric's permittivity/loss
tangent, plus per-metal sheet resistance/conductivity — is not in the GDS and
is not currently modeled anywhere in this repo. It has to come from a
stackup table keyed by PDK variant. **This data is not NDA'd**: sky130 is an
open PDK, and SkyWater/Google/efabless publish the process stack-up
(layer names, nominal heights and thicknesses, dielectric constants) as part
of the open PDK documentation — the same "open PDKs only" rule
(CLAUDE.md) that lets `klt sim` reference sky130's ngspice model library by
path (docs/cli/pdk.md) applies here: a stackup table is public data, checked
in or resolved the same way `klt pdk` resolves `libs.tech/`, never a
proprietary design rule.

**Proposed path, in stages:**

1. **Region selection.** A layout ref (block directory, per
   `layout-metrics.md`) plus a bounding region — either an explicit bounding
   box or a cell/instance reference — selects the subset of the layout to
   simulate. E&M solves are never full-chip; they are always a bounded
   region (a device, a net, a block boundary), matching all four ranked use
   cases.
2. **Per-layer polygon extraction.** Reuse the same `pya` batch traversal
   `klt layers`/`klt cells` already do, filtered to the region and to the
   layers the stackup table says are conductor or via layers.
3. **Extrusion.** Each 2D polygon is extruded to a 3D prism using the
   stackup table's height/thickness for its `(layer, datatype)`, and
   dielectric slabs are added between/around them from the same table. This
   is a pure geometry step (headless, no engine dependency yet).
4. **Meshing.** The extruded 3D solid model needs to become a mesh the
   solver consumes — a tetrahedral mesh for geode-fem's FEM/DG kernels, or a
   Cartesian/graded grid for openEMS's FDTD. This is the step the issue
   correctly flags as the hard part: acute-angle polygon corners, thin
   dielectric slivers between closely spaced traces, and via-to-metal
   junctions are exactly the features that make automatic 3D meshing of
   IC-style geometry harder than the CAD-solid meshing FEM tools are usually
   built for. The obvious bridge is an existing open-source 3D mesher run
   headlessly (e.g. `gmsh`, LGPL, scriptable via its own `.geo`/Python API
   with no GUI requirement) rather than writing a mesher from scratch — but
   this spike does not commit to one, since neither candidate engine's mesh
   ingestion format has been evaluated against real sky130 extrusions yet.
5. **Ports.** For use cases 1, 3, and 4, the solver needs port definitions
   (where current is driven in / S-parameters are referenced). The natural
   anchor is pin/net geometry — the same layout objects Phase 4 (`klt lvs`,
   extracted netlist) will eventually resolve to nets — so a port
   definition is proposed as a small companion list (layer + polygon or pin
   name + port type) rather than requiring the solver's own port syntax to
   be hand-authored per run.

Every step above is scriptable in batch (`pya`, a stackup JSON, a headless
mesher invocation, the solver's own CLI/API) with no GUI in the loop,
satisfying the headless-always rule end to end.

## 3. Engine survey

### geode-fem

| Property | Finding |
| -------- | ------- |
| Upstream | [rjwalters/geode-fem](https://github.com/rjwalters/geode-fem) — in-house, named as a candidate engine in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md. Burn-based ([burn.dev](https://burn.dev)) Rust FEM/DG electromagnetic solver, targeting the same problem class as [AWS Labs Palace](https://awslabs.github.io/palace/stable/) but on a differentiable, multi-backend GPU tensor IR. Not present in this machine's `~/GitHub` checkout at spike time; findings below come from the public repo's README via the GitHub API, not a local skim. |
| License | MIT (confirmed via the GitHub API) — no compatibility question for either an in-process or subprocess wrap, unlike the mixed ngspice/Xyce licensing the SPICE spike had to navigate. |
| Maturity | Driven + eigenmode FEM with multi-mode wave ports is on `main`, validated across five benchmark families: Mie sphere (eigenmode + driven scattering), patch antenna (S11/bandwidth/NTFF/efficiency), **spiral inductor (L/Q)**, an SLCFET capstone, and a slotless-PM motor torque benchmark. 200+ merged PRs; sparse `[nnz]` Nédélec assembly, Krylov COCG + ILU(0) iterative solver, block S-matrix wave ports (rank-N SMW augmentation) are all shipped, not roadmap items. |
| Headless story | Structurally headless already — a pure-Rust workspace invoked via `cargo run`/`cargo test`, no GUI dependency at any layer. GPU backend (`wgpu`/`cuda`/`metal`) is a compile-time feature; the default `wgpu` backend runs on Metal at runtime on macOS and falls back to the `ndarray` CPU backend on headless Linux CI, by the repo's own account — directly compatible with this repo's "headless always" rule with no adaptation needed. Optional visualization (benchmark "tearsheets", VTK/ParaView field export) is itself headless via `pvbatch`. |
| Accuracy vs. analytic oracles | Directly on point for our #1 use case: spiral-inductor L extracted from `Im(Z)/ω` across a frequency sweep is **within −4.9% of the Mohan analytic formula and −6.8% of MoM PEEC at 1 GHz** on a 3.5-turn 54,428-edge fixture; a second "SLCFET" spiral capstone (Au-on-SiC, 76,964 edges) extracts a quasi-static L₀ via Richardson extrapolation **within −2.1% of MoM PEEC and +2.8% of Mohan**, explicitly meeting a documented 5% bar. The patch-antenna benchmark validates S11/bandwidth against a Balanis cavity-model oracle, and the Mie-sphere benchmark validates eigenmode/driven scattering against the analytic Mie series — i.e. geode-fem already runs the exact style of oracle comparison this spike's wrap/build section (Section 5) proposes requiring. |
| Runtime cost | Not established by this survey. The repo's benchmark meshes (tens of thousands of edges) run on a sparse iterative solver, but no wall-clock numbers surface in the public README; a follow-on epic must benchmark geode-fem directly against mesh sizes a real sky130 block region produces (Section 2's pipeline does not exist yet, so today there is nothing to benchmark it against). |
| Fit to our geometry path | None of Section 2's GDS→mesh pipeline exists today — geode-fem consumes meshes, not GDS/OASIS files or a PDK stackup. Being in-house buys no head start here; the integration work is the same regardless of which engine is chosen. |

### strata-fdtd

| Property | Finding |
| -------- | ------- |
| Upstream | [rjwalters/strata-fdtd](https://github.com/rjwalters/strata-fdtd) — geode-fem's sister FDTD project, named in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md alongside geode-fem. MIT license. |
| Current scope | **Not an E&M solver today.** Its own README describes it as an "FDTD acoustic simulation toolchain for loudspeaker design and metamaterials" — a pressure-velocity acoustic FDTD with native C++/OpenMP kernels, optional GPU acceleration via PyTorch, and SDF/CSG geometry modeling for enclosures and Helmholtz resonators. geode-fem's own project-family table lists strata-fdtd's discretization as "FDTD" and status as "acoustic today, EM in progress" — confirming this is a planned, not shipped, capability. |
| Why it is surveyed anyway | geode-fem's README names the Mie-resonance benchmark as the intended cross-check triangulating "analytic Mie series ↔ strata FDTD ↔ GEODE-FEM eigenmode" — i.e. strata-fdtd is architecturally positioned to become a second in-house FDTD candidate once its EM mode lands, sitting alongside openEMS as an independent-discretization oracle for geode-fem. |
| Recommendation | **Track, do not wrap.** Not a candidate for this spike's contract; re-survey in the follow-on epic only if strata-fdtd's EM support has shipped by then. |

### openEMS

| Property | Finding |
| -------- | ------- |
| Upstream | [openEMS](https://openEMS.de) / [thliebig/openEMS-Project](https://github.com/thliebig/openEMS-Project) — mature, independently developed, in active use since ~2010; the reference open-source FDTD solver named explicitly in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md → "Mining the outside world." Octave/Matlab and Python scripting interfaces via the companion CSXCAD geometry library. |
| License | **GPL-3.0** (confirmed via the GitHub API on `thliebig/openEMS`). Same category as Xyce in the SPICE spike: fine to invoke as a subprocess, forecloses in-process/library embedding inside this repo's MIT surface. |
| Headless story | Achievable, with a scripting discipline. Structures are normally built via Octave/Python calls into CSXCAD (a geometry-definition API, not a GUI), and the `openEMS` FDTD engine itself is a CLI binary with no GUI dependency; the companion `AppCSXCAD` viewer is optional tooling for humans, never required to run a solve — the same "GUI is a viewer, never a dependency" shape this repo already holds KLayout to. |
| Accuracy vs. analytic oracles | Not independently measured in this survey (no local checkout, and this spike does not run either engine). openEMS's documentation and the broader FDTD literature cite validation against canonical antenna/scattering problems — the same problem class (patch antennas, resonant scattering) geode-fem validates against with its Mie-sphere and patch-antenna benchmarks. That overlap is exactly what makes openEMS a strong **independent-implementation oracle** for geode-fem, per Section 5, rather than something this spike can rank on absolute accuracy without running both. |
| Runtime cost | FDTD's cost scales with Courant-limited time-step count and total grid-cell count. IC routing geometry — sub-micron traces against a mm-scale die/block region — plausibly forces a much finer grid than an unstructured tetrahedral FEM mesh needs for the same geometry, even with openEMS's graded/nonuniform mesh support. This is a hypothesis for the follow-on epic to measure, not a finding of this spike. |
| Role | Mature, well-documented, and exactly the kind of outside engine the architecture doc calls for surveying — but the GPL-3 license caps its integration mode the same way Xyce's did for SPICE, and its clearest value here is as the cross-validation oracle for geode-fem's numbers rather than as a competing default (Section 5, Section 6). |

### Quasi-static extractors (FastHenry/FastCap class)

| Property | Finding |
| -------- | ------- |
| Upstream | FastHenry (inductance/resistance via partial-element-equivalent-circuit) and FastCap (capacitance via multipole boundary-element), both originally from MIT's Research Laboratory of Electronics. Their own project descriptions call them "the premium inductance/capacitance solver … a de-facto golden reference standard," and they are the classical tools for exactly the quasi-static regime our #1–#3 use cases live in (L/C extraction below self-resonance, per-unit-length RLGC). |
| License | **Resolved 2026-09-18 (issue #1886): FastHenry/FastCap are MIT-noncommercial and unpackaged — never a dependency, never an oracle, never ported.** The terms are MIT RLE's 1990s research notice, not an OSI license, present in FastHenry's own core (`src/fasthenry/induct.h`, `mulGlobal.h`) and in the FastCap-derived `zbuf/` code in every mirror (`ediloren/FastHenry2`, `ediloren/FastCap2`, and the `fasthenry-3.0wr` tarball inside `wrcad/xictools`, whose Apache-2.0 wrapper explicitly does not override inherited terms): *"Permission to use, copy and modify for internal, noncommercial purposes is hereby granted. Any distribution of this program or any part thereof is strictly prohibited without prior written consent of M.I.T. […] LICENSEE agrees not to make any copies except for LICENSEE'S internal noncommercial use."* Open-source *use* has a reasonable "noncommercial" reading, but the distribution clause means a derivative — including a clean Rust port — could never be released, which closes the modernization path this repo would actually want. Separately, there is no `fasthenry` package in Debian/Ubuntu, Homebrew, or PyPI, so even a CI-only subprocess-oracle plan (issue #1886 as originally filed) had nothing to install. The permissively-licensed replacement adopted for the cross-validation oracle role is **PyPEEC** (Dartmouth College, MPL-2.0) — see [`mom-cross-validation.md`](mom-cross-validation.md)'s "The spiral fixture's oracle" section. |
| Maturity | Numerically mature (decades of PEEC/multipole-method use), but the canonical implementations are aging Unix-era C with most current GitHub activity in downstream forks and wrappers rather than upstream maintenance — a different risk profile than ngspice's actively maintained upstream in the SPICE spike. |
| Fit | Right method class for the cheap end of Section 1 (T-line RLGC is FastHenry's original design point), but between the licensing (ambiguous when this spike was written; since resolved against these tools -- see the License row) and the fact that geode-fem's own SLCFET benchmark already demonstrates a quasi-static extraction mode (L₀ via Richardson extrapolation to f→0 on the same FEM solver, within 5% of MoM PEEC), there is a credible in-house alternative that avoids the licensing question entirely. |
| Recommendation | Name the method class as the right regime for the cheap use cases; do not adopt the specific unmaintained tools. Treat "cheaper than full FEM/FDTD" as a **solver mode** of whichever full-wave engine is adopted (quasi-static/DC-extrapolation), not a new external dependency — unless a follow-on epic's cost/accuracy measurements argue otherwise. |

## 4. Proposed JSON contract: `klt em`

Documented in the same field-table style as `klt sim`
(docs/cli/sim.md) and the shared envelope
([docs/json-contract.md](../json-contract.md)): `schema_version` (integer,
versioned per command, not the string-typed `"schema"` field the SPICE
spike originally proposed before that convention existed — `klt sim` itself
notes this deviation, and this spike adopts the settled convention directly
rather than repeating the now-corrected mistake). **This is a proposed
shape for review, not a shipped contract**, and no `klt` verb, dependency,
or line of solver-invoking code exists yet.

| Field                | Type              | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `layout`              | string            | Path to a block directory or a GDSII/OASIS file, per the `layout-metrics.md` block-directory convention. A *reference*, not inline geometry.                |
| `region`              | object            | Selects the layout subset to simulate: a `cell` (instance/cell name) and/or an explicit `bbox_um`. E&M solves are always bounded, never full-chip (Section 2). |
| `stackup`             | string            | PDK variant name (`sky130A`) resolved to a stackup table the same way `klt pdk` resolves `libs.tech/` — the metal/via height, thickness, and dielectric table from Section 2. Open PDK data only, never NDA'd. |
| `engine`              | string            | Engine selector (`geode_fem`, `openems`, …). Present from day one so engine choice is data, not a code path — the same convention `klt sim`'s `engine` field established. |
| `solve_mode`          | string            | `quasi_static`, `driven`, or `eigenmode` — maps directly to Section 1's per-use-case regime call.                                                            |
| `ports[]`             | array\<object\>   | `name`, a `pin` reference (net/pin name, anchored to layout geometry per Section 2) or explicit geometric port, `type` (`lumped`/`wave`), and `z0_ohm` reference impedance. |
| `frequency`           | object            | `start_hz`/`stop_hz`/`points` (linear sweep) or an explicit `points_hz` array — same sweep-vs-explicit-list shape `klt sim`'s corner axes already use.        |
| `outputs[]`           | array\<string\>   | Which reductions to compute from the raw field solve: `s_parameters`, `l`, `q`, `c`, `rlgc`, `srf`. Requesting an output not meaningful for the given ports/solve_mode is a documented application error. |
| `checks[]`            | array\<object\>   | Optional pass/fail assertions, in the same shape as `klt sim`'s `measurements[]`: `name`, which `output` and frequency point it reads, `unit`, and `limits` (`min`/`max`, either optional). A check with no `limits` is reported but never fails — the same "collect a value you're still characterising" escape hatch `klt sim` documents. |
| `options.mesh_resolution` | string        | Coarse knob (`default`, or engine-specific tiers) rather than exposing raw mesh parameters in v1 — the mesh pipeline itself (Section 2) is unbuilt, so this field is deliberately underspecified pending that work. |
| `options.timeout_s`   | integer           | Wall-clock budget for the whole solve. E&M solves are expected to run far longer than a SPICE corner, so this is a single run-level budget, not per-sub-step. |
| `options.keep_artifacts` | boolean        | Retain the mesh, field-solution files (VTK/HDF5), and solver logs on disk, referenced from the response — never inlined into JSON, the same rule `klt sim` applies to rawfiles/logs. |

}
```

Field semantics deliberately reuse `klt sim`'s precedents rather than
inventing new ones:

- **`fail`/`error` stay distinct**, exactly as `klt sim` defines them: `fail`
  means the solve produced a trustworthy result and a `checks[]` entry
  missed its limits; `error` means no trustworthy result exists (mesh
  generation failure, solver non-convergence, timeout). A missing/`null`
  result for a requested output is an `error`, never a silent `pass`.
- **`margin` sign convention** (positive headroom, negative violation,
  `null` when the value is `null`) is carried over unchanged from `klt sim`.
- **Reproducibility is in-band**: `environment` hashes both the layout and
  the resolved stackup, the same discipline `klt sim` applies to the
  netlist and model library.
- **Large artifacts are always references, never inlined** — mesh files and
  volumetric field solutions are far larger than SPICE rawfiles, making this
  rule more load-bearing here than it already is for `klt sim`.

### Proposed exit codes

| Exit code | Meaning                                                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`       | Solve completed and every declared `checks[]` entry passed (or none declared). |
| `1`       | Application-level error (bad layout/stackup ref, mesh generation failure, unresolved port). Documented error shape on stderr. |
| `2`       | Usage error — from argparse.                                                    |
| `3`       | Solve completed but at least one `checks[]` entry failed its limits.            |

This reuses `klt sim`'s open question rather than resolving it: `klt layers`
uses `1` for input errors and `2` for usage with no third code, while `klt
sim` (and now this proposal) need a pass/fail/broken trichotomy. That
convention should be settled once, repo-wide, when it is actually
implemented — not invented a third time by this spike.

## 5. Wrap or build?

Per docs/ARCHITECTURE.md → "Rewrite rule," a rewrite (here: absorbing
geode-fem's numerics into this repo rather than depending on it) is
permitted only when bottleneck-or-ceiling, oracle-exists, and unlock all
hold. **Geode-fem being in-house does not exempt it from this test** — the
issue is explicit about that, and this section applies the test as if
geode-fem were any outside engine:

1. **Bottleneck or ceiling — fails, and more so than the SPICE case.** There
   is no existing E&M capability to be a bottleneck in; this is greenfield.
   Framed as "would forking geode-fem's numerics into this repo ever be
   justified," the answer is no for the same reason SPICE numerics were a
   poor rewrite target: FEM/DG Maxwell solvers (mesh generation, absorbing
   boundary conditions, wave-port formulations) are an active research
   target — geode-fem's own roadmap lists open items (e.g. the "Whiteroom
   L4 mapping" tracker) — not a settled, forkable artifact.
2. **Oracle exists — holds, clearly.** Closed-form analytic references
   (Mohan's spiral-inductor equations — already the KB entry's own citation,
   parallel-plate/coupled-line capacitance formulas, telegrapher's-equation
   RLGC, canonical antenna/scattering solutions) plus openEMS as an
   independent-implementation cross-check give this domain more oracle
   coverage than SPICE had, not less — geode-fem already builds its own
   validation suite exactly this way.
3. **Unlock — holds, but for a different capability than this spike scopes.**
   geode-fem's differentiability (gradient-based inverse design of an
   inductor or T-line cross-section) is a genuine "a subprocess wrapper
   structurally cannot do this" unlock — but that is a reason to *choose*
   geode-fem as the wrapped engine for its optimization potential, per
   docs/ARCHITECTURE.md → "In-house prior art," not a reason to fork its
   numerics into this repo. The capability this spike scopes (S-parameter
   and L/Q/C extraction behind a JSON contract) does not itself require
   in-repo numerics.

One of three holds outright, one holds but argues for adoption rather than
forking, and one fails. **Recommendation: wrap, not rewrite** — the same
conclusion the SPICE spike reached, reached independently for a domain with
even less argument for absorbing the engine's internals.

**As with the SPICE spike, "wrap" undersells the whole answer.** Two
different things are in play:

- **Wrap the numerics.** Solver, mesh discretization, port/boundary
  formulations — geode-fem (or openEMS, or a future strata-fdtd EM mode),
  unmodified, invoked as a subprocess/library dependency. A poor rewrite
  target by the test above.
- **Build the geometry pipeline and the contract.** GDS region selection,
  stackup-driven extrusion, mesh-format translation, port definition from
  layout pins, frequency-sweep orchestration, `checks[]` evaluation, JSON
  emission (Section 2, Section 4). **Nothing exists to wrap here** — no
  engine, in-house or outside, ships GDS-to-EM-mesh translation for an IC
  metal stackup. This is the layer that is ours, first-class, written from
  scratch, exactly as the corner-matrix orchestration was the substantive
  finding of the SPICE spike.

**Validation bar before geode-fem becomes the *default* engine** (usable
behind the `engine` selector from day one is a lower bar than being the
default): the spike proposes reusing geode-fem's own documented target —
**≤5% relative error against an analytic closed form (Mohan, coupled-line
capacitance, telegrapher's-equation RLGC as applicable) and against openEMS
as an independent-implementation oracle** — but requires clearing it on
**geometry produced by this repo's own GDS→mesh pipeline** on a real sky130
fixture (the `sky130-spiral-inductor` KB entry's structure is the natural
first target), not merely citing geode-fem's existing idealized benchmark
fixtures. The pipeline is new integration surface geode-fem's own benchmark
suite has not exercised, and that gap is exactly where accuracy could
silently regress.

## 6. Alternatives considered

**Skip the spike, wrap geode-fem directly.** Rejected for the same reason
the SPICE spike rejected its analogous alternative: it violates "How
capabilities arrive" (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), and the in-house relationship
is precisely the case the architecture doc warns is *not* exempt. Skipping
the survey also risks a contract shaped by geode-fem's internal mesh/port
representations leaking into the JSON shape, rather than being derived from
the four ranked use cases independently.

**openEMS-first.** Rejected as the default, not as a candidate. openEMS is
mature and well-documented, and the survey should weigh that maturity
against geode-fem's differentiability and in-house maintainability rather
than assume incumbency wins by default. Its GPL-3 license also caps its
integration mode to subprocess-only, the same constraint that shaped the
SPICE spike's Xyce assessment. openEMS's strongest role coming out of this
survey is as the independent cross-validation oracle for geode-fem's
numbers — arguably a better use of its maturity than taking on a second
maintained dependency as the default path.

## Out of scope for this spike

No dependency was added to `pyproject.toml`, no `klt` subcommand was added,
no mesh-generation or GDS-to-solver-geometry code was written, no solver was
invoked, and no MCP surface was touched. Those remain candidate follow-up
epics gated on this spike's findings.

## Open questions for a follow-up epic

- The GDS→mesh geometry pipeline (Section 2) is the largest scoping
  question and was deliberately left unresolved here: which headless mesher
  bridges extruded sky130 solids to geode-fem's/openEMS's mesh formats, and
  how acute-angle polygon corners and thin dielectric slivers are handled
  without manual cleanup.
- ~~Where the sky130 stackup table itself lives as a `klt`-owned asset —
  bundled data file, derived from open_pdks files at resolve time, or a new
  `klt pdk stackup` subcommand alongside `klt pdk find`/`list`/`env`.~~
  **Settled** (issue #1609): `klt pdk stackup`, backed by a hybrid of both
  other options rather than either alone. Real tech LEFs were verified to
  carry thickness and sheet/per-cut resistance but **no elevation and no
  dielectric constant at all**, so the z axis and ε_r come from a curated
  per-family table checked in at `src/klayout_tools/pdk_stackup.py` (each
  entry citing the open, non-NDA'd open_pdks file it was transcribed from),
  while thickness and resistance are derived from the resolved install's own
  tech LEFs at run time, per parasitic corner. See
  [`docs/cli/pdk.md`](../cli/pdk.md)'s "`klt pdk stackup`" section for the
  emitted schema — its `conductors[]` entries carry `z0_um`/`z1_um`/
  `conductivity_S_per_m`/`gds_layer`, which is exactly the per-conductor
  shape both this document's proposed `klt em` request and the existing
  `klt mom` spec file consume.
- Port definition convention: pin/net-name based (anchored to Phase 4's
  eventual LVS-extracted nets) versus raw geometric ports defined
  independently of extraction — the request shape above assumes the former
  is preferred but does not commit.
- The exit-code trichotomy question `klt sim` already left open for `klt
  drc` now has a third claimant (`klt em`); it should be settled once,
  repo-wide, not invented a third time.
- Whether `s_parameters` should also emit a Touchstone (`.sNp`) artifact
  alongside the JSON scalar rollup, for direct use in downstream SPICE
  S-parameter blocks.
- Caching: an E&M solve is a pure function of (layout, stackup, ports,
  frequency-sweep) hashes, the same caching argument the SPICE spike made,
  and a stronger one here given the runtime cost gap between a SPICE corner
  and a field solve.
- Whether openEMS graduates from oracle-only to a second real
  implementation behind `engine` (the way Xyce is positioned for `klt sim`),
  or stays a validation-only tool that never ships behind the CLI.

## Recommendation

**geode-fem is the recommended default candidate for the full-wave use
cases (#1 spiral inductor near/above quasi-static, #4 block-boundary
S-parameters), once it clears the Section 5 validation bar on geometry
produced by this repo's own pipeline** — not on its existing idealized
benchmark fixtures alone. Its differentiability is also a forward-looking
asset for the optimization/inverse-design story docs/ARCHITECTURE.md already
names geode-fem for, which no other candidate here offers. **openEMS is
recommended as the primary cross-validation oracle**, not a competing
default — mature, independently implemented, and GPL-3-constrained to
subprocess invocation the same way Xyce was for SPICE. **strata-fdtd is not
yet a candidate** for E&M work (acoustic-only today) and should be
re-surveyed if/when its EM mode ships. For the quasi-static end of the
ranking (#2 MOM cap C, #3 T-line RLGC), the recommendation is to use
geode-fem's own quasi-static/DC-extrapolation solve mode rather than adopt
the FastHenry/FastCap class of tools. (Their licensing was recorded as
unresolved when this spike was written and is now settled the other way --
see the Section 3 license row: MIT-noncommercial and unpackaged, so never a
dependency, never an oracle, never ported.)

**The follow-on implementation epic** (to be filed separately, not by this
spike) should scope, in order: (1) the GDS+stackup→mesh geometry pipeline as
its own milestone — likely the majority of the engineering effort, the same
role corner-matrix orchestration played for the SPICE build; (2) a single
first vertical slice on the #1 use case (spiral inductor L/Q), reproducing
the `sky130-spiral-inductor` KB entry's structure as the fixture and
geode-fem's own Mohan/MoM-PEEC comparison as the oracle bar, before
generalizing to MOM caps, T-lines, or block S-parameters; and (3) settling
the exit-code trichotomy this spike, `klt sim`, and `klt drc` all now share
an open question about.
